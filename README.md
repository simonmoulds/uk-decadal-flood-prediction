A Snakemake workflow for making decadal flood predictions using CMIP5/6 decadal hindcasts. The workflow reproduces the results shown in the research article:

```

## Usage

This workflow uses Snakemake. Users should install Snakemake using [Mamba/Conda](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#installation-via-conda-mamba). It can then be run from the command line as follows: 

``` sh
snakemake --cores N --use-conda
```
where N is the number of cores you wish to use. Note that the workflow has been tested on MacOS (Monterey 12.6) and Linux systems only. On Windows it should work under the Windows Subsystem for Linux. 

The raw data needed to run the workflow is not available on this repository. It can be downloaded from the corresponding [Zenodo dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6940449).
